Discrete Structures
COURSE DESCRIPTION

Introduction to topics in discrete mathematics, including logic, sets, relations and functions, proofs by induction, recursive programs, graph theory, elementary number theory and elementary combinatorics.  The emphasis is on logical reasoning, clear presentation of proofs, and applications to problems in computing.

STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES

After successful completion of this course, students will be able to…

Formal logic – Prove validity of propositional formulas using truth tables, laws of logic, and the tree method.

Sets, Functions and Relations – Prove set identities using set-builder notation and laws of propositional logic.  Prove basic properties of functions (injective, surjective, bijective) and relations (reflexive, commutative, transitive) using logical reasoning.

Induction – Use inductive reasoning to solve problems and to prove properties of discrete structures and recursive programs.

Scheme - Implement recursive functions over lists, relations, and numbers.

Number Theory – Define and prove properties such as primality and relative primality.  Implement Euclid’s algorithm to calculate gcds. 

Modular Arithmetic – Define and prove properties of modular arithmetic, including Chinese Remaindering and Fermat’s Little Theorem.  Apply the theory to design and evaluate private- and public-key cryptographic systems.

Graphs – Prove basic properties of trees, Eulerian cycles, and planar graphs.
